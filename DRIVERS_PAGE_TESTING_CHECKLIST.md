## 🔧 Setup Required

### Database Migration
Run this SQL in Supabase to create the audit_logs table:

```sql
-- See: supabase/audit_logs_schema.sql
```

The file contains:
- Table creation
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes

1. **Audit Logs Table**: Needs to be created in database (SQL file provided)
2. **Date Handling**: Empty dates show placeholder "Set expiry date"
3. **Mobile Inline Editing**: Not implemented in mobile view yet (desktop only)
4. **Bulk Operations**: Still use old delete (no defensive delete yet)

## 📝 Next Improvements

- [ ] Add inline editing to mobile view
- [ ] Add defensive delete to bulk operations
- [ ] Add inline editing for more fields (phone, email, license number)
- [ ] Add undo/redo for inline edits
- [ ] Add optimistic updates for better UX
