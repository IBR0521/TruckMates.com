# ✅ CocoaPods Installation Successful!

All iOS dependencies have been installed successfully. You can now build the app in Xcode.

## Next Steps

### 1. Close Xcode
If Xcode is currently open, close it completely (Cmd+Q).

### 2. Open the Workspace (NOT the Project!)
**Important:** You must open the `.xcworkspace` file, NOT the `.xcodeproj` file!

In Terminal, run:
```bash
cd "/Users/ibrohimrahmat/Desktop/logistics-saa-s-design (1)/truckmates-eld-mobile/ios"
open TruckMatesELD.xcworkspace
```

Or manually:
- Finder → Navigate to `truckmates-eld-mobile/ios/`
- Double-click `TruckMatesELD.xcworkspace`

### 3. Build the App
1. Select a simulator in the device dropdown (top toolbar)
   - e.g., "iPhone 15", "iPhone 14 Pro"
2. Click the Play button (▶️) or press `Cmd + R`
3. The app should build and launch in the simulator!

## Important Notes

- Always use `.xcworkspace` file for React Native projects (not `.xcodeproj`)
