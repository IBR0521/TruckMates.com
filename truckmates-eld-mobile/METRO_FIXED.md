# ✅ Metro Config Fixed

I've created the missing `metro.config.js` file that Metro bundler needs.

## What Was Fixed

- Created `metro.config.js` in the project root
- This file is required for Metro bundler to work

## Next Steps

Metro bundler should now work correctly. You can:

1. **Start Metro bundler:**
   ```bash
   cd truckmates-eld-mobile
   npm start
   ```

2. **Or run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   # or
   npm run android
   ```

The Metro bundler will start automatically when you run the app from Xcode or via npm scripts.

**Note:** Metro bundler is the JavaScript bundler for React Native. It's required for the app to run.
