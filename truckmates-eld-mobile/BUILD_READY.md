# ✅ Build Issues Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Path Issue:** Renamed directory to remove parentheses (`logistics-saa-s-design-1`)
2. ✅ **Flipper Disabled:** Removed Flipper (debugging tool) that was causing header errors
3. ✅ **Pods Reinstalled:** All iOS dependencies reinstalled without Flipper (51 pods)
4. ✅ **Build Cache Cleaned:** Cleared Xcode DerivedData

## Current Status

- ✅ CocoaPods installed and configured
- ✅ All iOS dependencies installed (51 pods, no Flipper)
- ✅ Metro bundler configured
- ✅ Path fixed (no parentheses)
- ✅ Xcode workspace ready

## Next Steps

**In Xcode:**

1. Wait for indexing to complete (if it's still running)
2. Select a simulator (e.g., "iPhone 15", "iPhone 14 Pro")
3. Click **Play (▶️)** or press **Cmd + R**
4. The app should build successfully now!

**Note:** Flipper has been disabled. This is fine - it's only needed for debugging and can cause build issues. Your app will work perfectly without it.
